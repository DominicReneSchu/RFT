# Resonance Field Theory (Version 4.0)

[![License: RFT-License 1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-RFT--License%201.4-blue.svg)](license/RFT-license_v1.4.md)

Welcome to the official repository of the **Resonance Field Theory (RFT)**.
This project unifies mathematics, physics, and engineering into
an axiomatic model of resonance. The theory describes
fundamental processes as coupling and resonance phenomena in
oscillation fields — formally grounded in 7 axioms (A1–A7).

**Empirically validated in six domains:** Particle physics
(1,500,000 Monte Carlo simulations, 5 resonances, emp. p = 0),
Cosmology (1,530 FLRW simulations, Δd_η > 6σ),
Nuclear technology (resonance reactor, κ = 1, λ_eff/λ₀ = 7,872 for U-235),
Classical mechanics (double pendulum, ε(θ₂−θ₁) = cos²(Δθ/2)),
Quantum mechanics (Schrödinger simulation, Fidelity = 1.0, 1−F ~ λ²) and
Spacetime physics (warp drive — first positive-energy warp bubble).

## Core Formula and Central Quantities

The central equation of Resonance Field Theory (Axiom 4):

$$
E = \pi \cdot \varepsilon(\Delta\phi) \cdot \hbar \cdot f
$$

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|:------:|:-----|:--------|
| **π** | Pi | Geometric factor from the cyclic coupling geometry |
| **ε(Δφ)** | Coupling efficiency | Fraction of transferred resonance energy, ε ∈ [0, 1] |
| **ℏ** | Red. Planck constant | Action quantum (ℏ = h/2π) |
| **f** | Frequency | Oscillation frequency of the coupled mode |

### Coupling Efficiency ε

The coupling efficiency describes what fraction of the maximum
possible resonance energy is actually transferred between two coupled
modes.

**Standard model:** ε(Δφ) = cos²(Δφ/2) = ½(1 + cos Δφ)

| Coupling state | ε | Energy |
|----------------|---|--------|
| Perfect coupling (Δφ = 0) | 1 | π·ℏ·f |
| Planck special case (ground state) | 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159 | ½·ℏ·f |
| Natural damping | 1/e ≈ 0.368 | (π/e)·ℏ·f |
| Half coupling (Δφ = π/2) | 0.5 | π·ℏ·f/2 |
| No coupling (Δφ = π) | 0 | 0 |

The factor π arises from the integration of the coupling efficiency
over a half-cycle of phase space — not as a free parameter.
The Planck ground-state energy E = ½ℏf is the special case
ε = 1/(2π).

### Identity ε = η

The FLRW simulations show: the theoretical operator ε and
the measurable observable η (cross-term of two coupled
scalar fields) are identical:

$$
\varepsilon(\Delta\phi) = \eta(\Delta\phi) = \cos^2(\Delta\phi / 2)
$$

This identity eliminates the last free parameter:
In the resonance reactor κ = 1 follows exactly.

## Axiom System (Summary)

The RFT consists of 7 core axioms that are minimal, independent, formally
precise, and empirically testable:

| Axiom | Core statement | Formula |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| A1 | Universal oscillation | ψ = A·cos(kx − ωt + φ) |
| A2 | Superposition | Φ = Σ ψᵢ |
| A3 | Resonance condition | \|f₁/f₂ − m/n\| < δ |
| A4 | Coupling energy | E = π·ε·ℏ·f |
| A5 | Energy direction | E⃗ = E·ê(Δφ, ∇Φ) |
| A6 | Information flow | MI > 0 ⟺ PCI > 0 |
| A7 | Invariance (G_sync) | G(fᵢ/fⱼ) = G(T(fᵢ)/T(fⱼ)) |

Additionally there is an interpretative extension:
- **E1 (Observer as resonator):** Follows from A1, A3, A6

## Empirical Validation

The RFT is empirically validated across four independent domains:

| Domain | Method | Result | Axioms |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Particle physics | 1,500,000 MC sim. on CMS data | 5 resonances, emp. p = 0 | A3, A7 |
| Cosmology | 1,530 FLRW simulations | Δd_η > 6σ, Δχ² = +16 vs CMB | A1, A3–A5, A7 |
| Nuclear technology | Resonance reactor (GDR-based) | κ = 1, λ_eff/λ₀ = 7,872 (U-235) | A1, A3, A4 |
| Classical mechanics | Double pendulum + coupled oscillators | ε(θ₂−θ₁) = cos²(Δθ/2) | A1, A2, A4 |
| Quantum mechanics | Schrödinger simulation | Derivation of Schrödinger eq. from A4; Fidelity = 1.0 (4 scenarios); 1−F ~ λ² confirmed | A4 |
| Spacetime physics | Warp drive simulation | First positive-energy warp bubble; w sign change via ε(Δφ) phase control | A4, A5 |

**Falsification tests:**
- Monte Carlo test: 1,500,000 simulations, 5 resonances, emp. p = 0 (A3 confirmed)
- CERN resonance analysis: significant resonance excesses in mass data (A1, A3, A7)
- Resonance reactor prediction: σ_coh > σ_incoh (experimentally testable)
- Schrödinger simulation: falsifiable prediction |Δ⟨x⟩| ≈ 2.0·λ µm for ⁸⁷Rb atoms
